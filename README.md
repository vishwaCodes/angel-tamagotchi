# Angel Tamagotchi

A cute Tamagotchi game built by me for my first ever Coding Project. 

# About the Game

Meet your adorable Tamagotchi friend! 
You will need to feed your little pet, make sure it gets enough sleep and play with it to ensure it doesn't get bored. Your pet is just one year old. Interact with your Tamagotchi and see how it grows! Your pet is in the danger of running away should it hit 3 on a scale of 1-10 on its Hunger, Sleepiness or Boredom Level. Will you be able to be a responsible Tamagotchi Parent?
